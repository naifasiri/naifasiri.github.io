<h2>SOCCER RULES</h2>
<p>It is just as important for coaches to teach the rules (FIFA Laws of the Game) to their players as it 
is to teach skills and tactics. Coaches must know all of the rules and their applications completely in 
order to do so. As such, it is strongly recommended that coaches print out the FIFA Laws of the Game book 
and read and study it thoroughly. The link for the FIFA website which goes directly to the Laws of the 
Game book is contained under ”The Rule Book” tab. It is further recommended that coaches contact their 
local organization for referees and attend training sessions. </p>

<h2>Fouls and Misconduct</h2>
<p>
There's a difference between fouls and misconduct that many people fail to understand. A foul can occur when 
a player tries to get the ball from his opponent and kicks him or pushes him away accidentally, whereas 
misconduct means that a player willfully targets his opponent and punches, kicks or pushes him away. </p>
<p>Fouls can only occur when the ball is in play, but misconduct can occur when it's out of play as well. 
Depending on the seriousness of the foul or misconduct, the referee can penalize it with a yellow or red 
card in addition to a free kick or penalty kick. </p>
<p>If a player rams into the other player, or tackles him with malicious intent, or does anything that 
hampers the other player’s progress like pull the shirt or push him with force, the referee has no choice 
but to award a free kick. The free kick that is as a result of these actions is called a direct free kick. 
A direct free kick is supposed to be taken from the same place where the offense took place. A penalty 
kick is awarded if any of the above mentioned offenses take place inside the penalty area. Even if the 
player who is the subject of the offense doesn’t have the ball, a penalty kick is still awarded. On the 
other hand, an indirect free kick is awarded if the goalkeeper handles the ball inside his half when a 
fellow team mate passes it to him or a fellow team mate throws the ball towards him. The referee also has 
the liberty to show either a yellow or a red card as a result of any foul or misconduct done on the pitch 
during the course of the game. The offenses that get a yellow card are called cautionable offenses and the 
referee sees the foul or misconduct as something that needs to be addressed, like a tackle from behind or 
abusing the referee or another player on the field. A red card or a sending off action is done when the 
player re-does another offense even after he has been cautioned or does something that shows malicious 
intent. </p>

<h2>Soccer Cards</h2>
<p>
Soccer referees use yellow cards to communicate an official caution to a player, substitute or substituted 
player. Unlike a verbal warning, a yellow card can have more drastic and long-lasting effects. There are a 
number of reasons a referee might show a player a yellow card, some of which are set in stone while others 
are at the referee's discretion. </p>
<p>STANDARD PLAYER CAUTIONS. A referee will show a player a yellow card for a number of standard offenses, 
as defined by FIFA's Laws of the Game. Delaying the restart of play is a direct yellow card offense, as is 
a failure to maintain the required distance from a restart. Both potential cautions apply to corner kicks, 
free kicks and throw-ins. According to FIFA, a player always must receive permission from the referee 
before entering, re-entering or deliberately leaving the field of play. Doing so without the referee's 
permission is a direct yellow card offense. </p>

<p>UNSPORTING BEHAVIOR AND DISSENT. The referee uses his discretion when deciding to caution a player for 
unsporting behavior or dissent. Unsporting behavior includes any attempt to cheat or circumvent the laws 
of the game. It also covers acts of aggression such as swearing, spitting or striking another player. 
Dissent includes any word or action that shows disdain for or opposition to the referee's rulings. Arguing 
with the referee often leads to a yellow card, but the boundaries are not always clear. If a player uses 
foul language when talking directly to the referee, she almost certainly will receive a yellow card. 
Dissent by action includes any physical display of anger after a refereeing decision. For example, kicking 
the ball away in anger, throwing a water bottle or striking a corner flag could result in a yellow card. </p>

<p>PERSISTENT INFRINGEMENT OF THE LAWS. Some actions, such as overly aggressive tackles, might result only 
in a free kick to the opposition. If a player continues to foul in this manner, however, the referee might 
decide to show him a yellow card for persistent infringement of the laws. </p>

<p>SUBSTITUTE CAUTIONS. The referee can caution players even if they are not on the pitch. This includes 
substitute players sitting in the dugout or warming up on the touchline. These players can be cautioned 
for unsporting behavior, dissent by word or action or delaying the restart of play. </p>

<p>TWO YELLOW CARDS. If a player receives a second yellow card during the course of a single match, the 
referee will immediately show her a red card and order her off the field of play. The player cannot return 
to the field of play during the match and her team will have no option but to play with one fewer player. </p>

<p>SUSPENSIONS. In many professional organizations, a player will receive a fine, suspension or both if he 
receives a certain number of yellow cards during the season. Both fines and suspensions occur in Major 
League Soccer. According to the 2011 MLS Disciplinary Summary, a player receives a $250 fine and a 
one-game suspension after accruing five yellow cards during the course of a season. </p>

<h2>The field of play</h2>
<p>
To begin with, the surface of any football field is extremely important and according to the rulebook the 
playing surface can be artificial grass or proper grass but the color of the surface has to be in every 
case green. If an artificial surface is used for a club game or an international fixture, the surface or 
turf (as it is more commonly known) needs to be in accordance with FIFA’s quality control regarding the 
turf (FIFA quality concept for football turf). </p>
<p>The football field is supposed to be rectangular in shape and there are line markings called touch lines 
and goal lines. The touch lines are the line markings that run along the boundary of the field whereas the 
goal lines are the relatively shorter lines. One line called the halfway line divides the football field 
into two halves and joins the boundary lines via their centre point. A mark is made on the centre of the 
half way line and is surrounded by a circle which has a measurement radius of 9.15m.  </p>
<p>The dimensions of the touch lines are as follows: </p>
<p>Length of the touch line is a minimum of 90m and a maximum of 120m </p>
<p>Width of the goal line is a minimum of 45m and a maximum of 90m </p>
<p>Whereas for international matches, the dimensions are different and they are: </p>
<p>Length of the touch line is a minimum of 100m and a maximum of 110m </p>
<p>Width of the goal line is a minimum of 45m and a maximum of 90m. </p>
<p>However all lines, be it the touch line or the goal line, have to be of the same width i.e. not more 
than 12cm.
On the field of play is also the goal area. The goal area is basically comprised of two lines that are 
drawn on a 90 degree angle to the goal line itself and are drawn 5.5m from the inside of each goalpost. 
Subsequently the area that is made after these lines are drawn is called the goal area.
There is also the penalty area which is used in the case of any penalty kick that is to be taken; it is 
also made by drawing lines from within the goal post area going up to 16.5m at a 90 degree angle from the 
goal line itself. There is a spot placed in the middle of the penalty area from where the kicks are taken.
On every corner is placed a flag post which is a non pointing top with a flag and is 5ft high.
The goal is placed at the center of each goal line. It consists of two vertical bars that are at an equal 
distance from the corner flags are joined together from a horizontal bar. The material that is to be used 
for the purpose of making the goal has to be FIFA approved for example it can be wood or metal. A net is 
to be attached to the goal itself and for safety purposes it must be stuck firmly in the ground as to 
avoid any injuries from it. </p>

<h2>The ball in and out of play</h2>
<p>
During the course of the game, there are certain laws that govern when the ball is considered “out” of 
play or “in” play per se. The ball is considered out of play when a player plays the ball and it goes out 
of the touchline. The basic law is that the ball should pass the touchline, either in the air or along the 
ground. Either this or the ball is deemed out of play if the referee stops the proceedings of the game for 
some reason. </p>
<p>On the other hand, if the ball rebounds off the goalpost, the corner flag or the assistant referee 
provided he is in the field of play. If the ball hits the referee during the game, the referee does not 
stop play and the ball is still considered to be in play. </p>

<h2>The Ball</h2>
<p>
The ball to be used in a football game should have certain physical attributes. For instance it should 
always weigh a minimum of 410g and a maximum of 450g before the match starts whereas the circumference of 
the football to be used should be a minimum of 68cm and a maximum of 70cm. The shape of the football 
should be sphere and can be made of either leather or other material which has to be approved by FIFA. </p>
<p>However, if the ball becomes defected during the course of play, the referee stops the match and gets 
the replacement ball and the match is re-started. The process of re-starting the match is basically the 
referee dropping the replacement ball at the same place where it got defected and the play was stopped. If 
the ball bursts or gets defected when not in play, the match is re-started using the new ball.
Although these rules exist, the ball may NOT be changed at anytime in the game without the authority and 
consent of the referee. </p>
