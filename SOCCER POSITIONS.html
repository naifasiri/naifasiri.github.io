<h2>SOCCER POSITIONS</h2>
<P>It is often the case that even the most die-hard football fans sometimes get confused when it comes to 
different positions in football that players play at. Many times when you are watching a football game 
the person doing the commentary says something that sounds like gibberish to you. </p>
<p>To cut the long story short, here is a summarized description of every conventional football position 
that one may come across while either watching the game or in a discussion with friends. </p>

<h3>Goalkeeper</h3>
<p>
As a the name suggests, the job of the goalkeeper is to keep the goal safe and make sure that any 
ball sent towards the goal is either held or punched to safety. A good goalkeeper is required to have a 
lot of moral character and absolute fitness to function properly in the position. A good goalkeeper can 
keep the goal safe and ensure a clean sheet; on the contrary a bad goalkeeper can lay all efforts made 
by the team to waste if he doesn't perform properly. The Goalkeeper can also play an integral part in an 
attacking move by guiding the ball up the field.
 </p>

<h3>Center Fullback</h3>
<p>
The center-full back position in football is considered to be the heart of the defense position. Playing 
right in front of the goalkeeper, the fullbacks have the duty to make sure any offensive move by the 
opposition team is dealt with. Center fullbacks are usually well built players who have good vision and 
are good in the air (which means they are good headers of the ball). The center full-backs can also make 
an offensive run if the team is making a counter-attack after breaking the opposing team forward runs. 
Passing is also key and the ability to fluently get the ball from defense to mid-field is an essential 
skill required by the center full-backs.
 </p>
 
<h3>Left/Right Fullback</h3>
<p>
The left/right fullback position in defense is yet again a very key position in a game of football. They 
cover the far corners of the pitch and make sure that any sudden burst made by the opposing midfield or 
the opposing strikers is stopped. In the recent past, left/right full-backs also play a pivotal role in 
any attack that a team makes. Ashley Cole of Chelsea/England is one such example who is at the heart of 
every attack made by the team. Bacary Sagna of Arsenal/France is also a diverse example of an aggressive 
attacking Fullback, though in most cases the right/left fullbacks are instructed to hold their position.
 </p>
 
 <h3> Left/Right Midfielder</h3>
 <p>
Midfield as the name suggests is the middle battling ground in a game of football. The midfield line is 
an initial stop to the aggressive offense by the opposition and is also the starting point for any attack 
that is a counter. A player playing in the mid-field on the left or the right is required by the nature 
of the position to have a good strength and precision crossing abilities, crossing abilities so that when 
there is an attack the pinpoint crossing can find the striker to eventually score.
 </p>
 <h3> Defensive Midfielder</h3>
 <p>
The defensive midfielder has the task to play in a role that supports the defense but also facilitates 
the midfield area of the pitch. A typical example of an effective defensive midfielder is Alex Song of 
Cameroon/Arsenal. A lot of character and patience is a prerequisite to play in this position. To hold any 
surging midfield attacks made and to run with the ball in the opposing half to start a move are one of 
the many duties of a defensive Midfielder.
 </p>
 <h3>Central Midfielder </h3>
 <p>
The two central midfield positions are base camp for any attack. The ability to pass with precision and 
keep the ball and not give it away is an important skill that any central midfielder has to possess in 
order to play with proper proficiency. As the job of the midfield is also to stop any proceeding attacks 
from the other team, the central midfielders must also resist and retaliate if any attack does 
materialize so that the defense gets a little breathing space.
 </p>
 
 <h3> Attacking/Offensive Midfielder </h3>
 <p>
The offensive midfielder plays a little ahead of the normal midfield line and usually scores goals. Due 
to this factor the team as a whole and the manager also rely on the offensive midfielder to make play 
even if he doesnâ€™t score. Cesc Fabregas of Arsenal/Spain is one of the best offensive midfielders in the 
world right now and his strategy is simple, pass the ball to the strikers with precision or run with the 
ball himself and score. A good eye for the ball and a good ability to tackle and dribble is very 
important.
 </p>
 
 <h3> Center Forward </h3>
 <p>
To succeed as a center forward, the will to actually score and the drive to make a good run down the 
field of play is an essential factor. The centre forward also needs to be patient because majority of 
the 90 minutes of the normal course of the game, the center forward will be without the ball because he 
will be too busy running around making space for his team mates to pass the ball around. Good heading 
abilities can also act as an essential ability when the style of the team is the long ball playing style.
