<h2>SOCCER HISTORY</h2>
	<p>Soccer is one of the most popular sports in Europe and the Americas. It has a vivid and 
interesting history in the world of sports. Early evidence of soccer being played as a sport finds 
occurrence in China during the 2nd and 3rd centuries BC. In China, it was during the Han dynasty that 
people dribbled leather balls by kicking it into a small net. Recorded facts also support the fact that 
Romans and Greeks used to play ball for fun and frolic. Some facts point to Kyoto in Japan where kicking 
of ball was a popular sport.</p>
<p>It is said that early growth of the modern soccer started in England. Some amusing facts even mention 
that the first ball used was the head of some Danish brigand. It is said that during medieval times, the 
old form of soccer used to allow many ill practices like kicking, punching, biting and gouging. The main 
aim was to carry the ball to a target spot. People grew so fond of the game that they would throng the 
field all day long. Sometimes the competition grew fierce and masses got so wild that there were frequent 
incidents of violence during the game. It is also said that soldiers admired the game so much that they 
missed archery practice to watch it. </p>
<p>King Edward III banned soccer in 1365 owing to the growing incidents of violence and military 
indulgence in the sport. In 1424 King James I of Scotland also proclaimed in the Parliament - "Na man play 
at the Fute-ball" (No man shall play football). </p>
<p>When and where exactly did soccer start is a question that has no precise answer to it. You can easily 
say that this popular game has been played for more than three thousand years. The nativity of modern-day 
soccer must be credited to Britain. It was also known as the association football, with Scotland and 
England being the co-founders of the systematic game of soccer. </p>

<h3>Modern History of Soccer: 18th Century onwards</h3>
<p>In 1815, a major development took place that made soccer popular in Universities, Colleges and 
Schools. The popular English School and Eton College came forth with a set of rules, known as the 
Cambridge Rules. Football was segregated into two groups; some colleges and schools opted for Rugby rules 
that allowed tripping, shin kicking and also carrying the ball. These rules were exclusively prohibited 
as per the Cambridge rules. </p>
<p>The history of modern-day soccer was established in 1863. In October 1863, eleven representatives from 
London clubs and schools met at the Freemason's Tavern to set up common fundamental rules to control the 
matches amongst themselves. The outcome of this meeting was the formation of the Football Association. In 
December 1863, the Rugby Football and Association football finally split as the supporters of the Rugby 
School rules walked out. </p>
<p>Firmly establishing the foundation of soccer in 1869, the Football Association strictly banned any 
kind of handling of the ball. Soccer's popularity spread rapidly during the 1800s as British sailors, 
traders and soldiers introduced the sport to different parts of the globe. </p>
<p>Italians, Austrians and Germans drew to Europe, while Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil adopted the sport 
in South America. FIFA was established in the year 1904 and by early 1930s, different leagues were 
operating from various countries. FIFA is credited with organizing the first world cup in Uruguay. The 
history of soccer is rich with events, development and its growing craze all over the world. You will 
find yourself amazed as you learn about different times of this wonderful sport that has held our awe and 
admiration for over 3000 years.</p>
